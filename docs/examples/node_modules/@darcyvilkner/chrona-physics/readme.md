# Chrona Physics

Chrona is a 2d JavaScript physics engine designed for developers who want precise control over motion and collisions. It models time continuously, calculates collisions exactly, and represents motion as affine transformations that evolve linearly over time.

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/darcyvilkner/chrona-physics) for learning Chrona.
